              <p class="faq-answer hero-faq-1-answer-para">While you could try this path, there is an abundance of knowledge necessary to have in order to properly take care of your pool. This goes beyond just knowing how to clean the pool; there is an entire world of chemistry to learn to protect your pool and swimmers.</p>

              <hr>
              <p class="faq-answer hero-faq-2-answer-para">People that take care of their own pools tend to rely on the advice of pool store counter workers who are typically not seasoned professionals and end up spending a LOT of money on chemicals that they don’t need nor know how to properly use. They usually end up spinning their wheels in frustration while wasting their time and money.</p>

              <hr>
              <p class="faq-answer hero-faq-3-answer-para">During the warm season, it is essential that the chemistry is checked and balanced on a weekly basis to avoid algae and unsafe swimming conditions. In the wintertime we offer biweekly service.</p>

              <hr>
              <p class="faq-answer hero-faq-4-answer-para">In a large company there is typically a revolving door of new inexperienced pool techs and you are often stuck speaking with the office manager instead of the person servicing your pool. They usually make you wait weeks to be helped, while we can almost always take care of you right away!</p>

              <hr>
              <p class="faq-answer hero-faq-5-answer-para">Swimming pools are simply too expensive to leave it up to anyone but a professional to maintain. Mistakes can be costly and you want to protect your high ticket items such as the plaster, tile, pump and filter. Pool service is also a great investment to ensure your pool water is safe for swimmers!</p>

              <hr>
              <p class="faq-answer hero-faq-6-answer-para">About 85% of our customers keep their pool open all year. By doing this, you save on the opening and closing costs not to mention a multi-thousand dollar pool cover. And since chlorine usage drops by about 95% in the wintertime, your chemical bill is extremely cheap during this time. And people love to look at their beautiful pool even if they aren’t using it.</p>
